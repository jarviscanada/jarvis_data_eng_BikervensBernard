The video hosting was made using amazon web services and the client side was developed using my web framework of choice, Vue.js and deployed using vercel.com The back-end was fully made in javascript using tool like Node.js for the server and graphql and mongodb for the database. The goal was mostly to show how I as a Developer would implement a huge architecture like tiktok and how i would use OOP to implement different design pattern to roll out an engaging algorithm.",

This agent keep track of each node's hardware characteristics and real-time resource utilization (e.g. CPU/Memory) for future resource planning purposes (e.g. add/remove servers that might be too slow or underused). The data will be saved in a PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS). The SQL queries will answer business questions such as 'show average memory usage in percentage over 1 minute intervals for each node'.",

  "summary": "My name is Bernard, and I'm a software developer. My job is to design computer applications or programs. I do this by building a complex architecture in an array of different technologies based on current needs. I design, implement, test and deploy modern solutions to everyday technological concerns. I went on to complete a 3-year DEC degree in computer science technology (software development) at Maisonneuve College in Montreal I am very passionate about technology and software development because it has allowed me to express my creativity while resolving my need to always learn and work and solve problems. It started from myspace.com allowing me as a kid to edit basic HTML/CSS. It was an amazing feeling to be able to express my creativity in such a medium and this is why now I'm very passionate about this industry."
