# Bikervens Bernard . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Bernard, I completed a 3-year DEC degree in computer science technology (software development) at Maisonneuve College in Montreal and I'm a software developer. My job is to design computer applications or programs. I do this by building a complex architecture in an array of different technologies based on current needs. I design, implement, test and deploy modern solutions to everyday technological concerns. I am very passionate about technology and software development because it has allowed me to express my creativity while meeting my need to always learn and work to solve problems.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a CentOS based Linux node cluster agent and designed the database table schemas, and business problem queries. The implemented custer agent keep track of each node's hardware characteristics and real-time resource utilization (e.g. CPU/Memory) for future resource planning purposes (e.g. add/remove servers that might be too slow or underused). The data will be saved in a PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS). The SQL queries will answer business questions such as 'show average memory usage in percentage over 1 minute intervals for each node'.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Java app which can post|show|delete Twitter post via Twitter REST API. The app use a Java DAO to interact with Twitter. Springboot was used to handle app dependencies and to ensure all the app layers functioned accordingly when run from the CLI. The app was then built using Maven and then deployed through Dockerhub as a Docker image for easy distribution and execution
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java tool with JDBC to get data in and out of an application (using any relational database). Built using Maven, the app use a PSQL docker instance Database that interacts with a DAO Data structure for easy application layer and database management
  - Grep App: Developed a simple grep app in Java. The app searches recursively for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and output matched lines to a file. The app was dockerized and deployed on Dockerhub for easy access and distribution.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed a trading system with the microservice architecture and Springboot framework. Since this is a PoC (proof of concept), I did not need to deal with the real banking or exchange systems. This PoC project focuses on features (e.g. functionalities, and feasibilities) rather than performance and security. The trading platform is a REST API consumed by the front-end applications. The application allows users to manage client profiles and accounts, monitor portfolio performance, and trade securities. The Springboot app fetches data from IEX Cloud which offers free market data (e.g. stock price) via its REST API. 

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BikervensBernard/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Not started

## Highlighted Projects
**Go game (Education)**: Implemented a Go game (an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent) in java while using jSwing widget toolkit for the GUI

**Schedule planing**: Implemented a C# api using the .NET framework to access to the ministry of education's course descriptions and requirements in order to help teachers from Maisonneuve college build each semester's syllabus. The generated and downloadable result was a document that communicates information about a specific academic course or class and defines expectations and responsibilities. The application was available via the school's portal and the api was used for the mobile app as well.

**TikTok Clone (PoC)**: Implemented a TikTok clone to help viewers watch and discover a multitude of personalized short videos. The video hosting was made using amazon web services and the client side was developed using my web framework of choice, Vue.js and deployed using vercel.com The back-end was fully made in javascript using tool like Node.js for the server and graphql and mongodb fo the database. The goal was mostly to show how I, as a Developer, would implement a huge architecture like tiktok and how i would use OOP to implement different design pattern to roll out an engaging algorithm.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Implemented, tested, and deployed a Bash script program using Linux command lines, Bash scripts, a PostgreSQL instance, Git Flow, and Docker using Agile/Scrum methodology. Oversaw daily stand-up meetings (daily scrums), which coordinated and tracked team progress. Managed each aspect of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) architecture.

**Test automation specialist, Equisoft (2020-2021)**: Developed, maintained created and executed End to End clear and concise functional tests cases using selenium and the .NET framework. for the automation. Extended existing test automation or create new scripts to provide a high level of test coverage across existing functionalities.
