## **Introduction**

The Jarvis Securities Team wants to develop a trading platform REST API (which is your next project [](https://www.notion.so/12c2e58517d543889d35ca337752aeff) ). As a junior developer, you will be involved in the entire [SDLC](https://www.notion.so/SDLC-d104522f8afb4edc9224fdd25348bf6a) . However, your team lead wants you to master core java before joining the trading app project. Core Java is the foundation of data engineering since most backend services and big data frameworks (e.g. Hadoop, Spark) are developed in Java or JVM-based languages.

# **Design**

As a junior developer, you will develop two Java applications:

- A Java app that mimics Linux `grep` command which allows users to search matching strings from files.
- A Java application that read, write, update, and deletes (CURD) data against an RDBMS database using JDBC

# Implementation

You will need to implements three Java applications using the following technologies:
